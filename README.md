## How does it work

This project uses wa-js which extracts some functions from WhatsApp fonts.

## How to use this project

In the near future we will be releasing them on the playstore and if we succeed we will also launch them on the appstore or you can run this app on your local machine using the necessary dependencies to run a react native app, see here -> <https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup>

## Development

This is a React Native project and to run it we use common react native scripts:

```bash
# install the depencencies
npm install

# start the app in development mode on android
npm run android

# start the app in development mode on ios
npm run ios # or build:dev for development

# lauch the metro bundle
npm run start

# exec the tests
npm run test

# exec the lint
npm run lint
```
